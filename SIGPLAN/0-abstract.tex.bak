Currently, the increasing number of Apps installed in mobile systems can help users to accomplish different tasks. However, the complex functionalities of Apps and different user behaviors post new challenges for the management of mobile systems. Predicting and analyzing user App behavior become important techniques to improve performance, energy efficiency and user experience in mobile systems. Some machine learning methods, such as Bayesian Network, have been proposed to predict App Usage. However, there are some problems to be ignored in those methods. First, the previously methods make use of long-term training samples to train the model. In this paper, we have demonstrated that it is unnecessary to use a massive sample scale. Second, the prediction model is used on the smartphone once, we need to consider how often the model is trained.
So in this paper, we test the influence of different size of training set on prediction accuracy and also proposed an adaptive method to adjust the training frequency dynamically. On the one hand, Our proposed adaptive method can nearly reduce the training frequency by half. On the other hand, it can ...
